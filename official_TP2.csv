"All possible measures to be taken before schools and colleges close,""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/all-possible-measures-to-be-taken-before-schools-and-colleges-close"",""New contingency planning guidance published for education settings in local lockdown areas"","""",""tag:www.gov.uk,2005:/government/news/all-possible-measures-to-be-taken-before-schools-and-colleges-close"", Today (28 August) the government has published detailed guidance for schools on contingency planning for areas with local lockdowns in place. The guidance sets out that all possible measures should be taken before any restrictions are imposed on schools to maintain consistent education for children and young people. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: Our primary focus remains supporting all schools to welcome back all pupils for the start of term and we thank teachers and staff for their hard work in preparations We hope that we won’t have to implement the guidance set out today because the local lockdown measures we have introduced so far are working. Changes to school attendance will only ever be an absolute last resort. However, it is important that both government and schools prepare for a worst case scenario, so this framework represents the sensible contingency planning any responsible government would put in place. he updated CONTAIN guidance sets out four tiers of restrictions for education settings, for use as an absolute last resort in areas subject to local restrictions. All schools, colleges and other education settings are opening for the start of term, with all those in areas subject to local restrictions currently at Tier 1 – fully open to all pupils full time, with face coverings required in corridors and communal areas for pupils in Year 7 and above. Local authority leaders and directors of public health, alongside national government, would be at the centre of any decision making to move out of Tier 1 for education settings. They would take all other possible measures, including implementing restrictions on other sectors, before considering restricting attendance in education. If all other measures have been exhausted, Tier 2 would advise secondary schools and colleges in a restricted area to use rotas to help break chains of transmission of coronavirus, while primary schools remain open to all pupils. Tiers 3 and 4 introduce remote learning full time for wider groups of pupils, with vulnerable children and children of critical workers continuing to attend. The government asked schools in July to ensure they were able to provide high quality remote education that mirrors in-school education, in case any pupils were required to self-isolate or local restrictions were needed. These plans should extend to rotas if ever required. All children are due to return to school for the autumn term and schools have been putting in place protective measures to reduce the risk of transmission. School staff have been working to implement increased hygiene and handwashing with children remaining in consistent groups, using measures such as staggered break times to keep groups apart. To further reassure parents and teachers that all proportionate measures are being taken to make schools as safe as possible, the government has announced that in areas of the country currently subject to enhanced restrictions, staff and pupils in secondary schools should wear face coverings in communal areas where social distancing cannot be maintained. From this week, schools and colleges have begun receiving home testing kits, each receiving a pack of 10 tests, with more available to be ordered if needed. The home testing kits are to be used in exceptional circumstances such an individual with symptoms who may have barriers to accessing a test elsewhere and the home kit would significantly increase their chance of getting tested. This will enable schools and colleges to take swift action to protect others if the test result is positive. Schools are also receiving packs of PPE to use in the very limited circumstances it may be required, such as when it is not possible for a staff member to maintain 2m distance from a pupil with a suspected case of coronavirus. This week the Chief Medical Officers from all four nations in the United Kingdom made it clear that the risks to children contracting Covid-19 in school or college is extremely low and that the risks associated with not being in school or college outweighs that of not being there. The Department for Education has also published further guidance to help schools plan for potential Tier 2 restrictions, which will involve secondary year groups operating a rota system in order to reduce pupil numbers on-site."
"Restrictions lifted in parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire,""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/restrictions-lifted-in-parts-of-greater-manchester-lancashire-and-west-yorkshire"",""Locally led approach seeing results as COVID-19 cases drop in some hotspot areas in northern England."","""",""tag:www.gov.uk,2005:/government/news/restrictions-lifted-in-parts-of-greater-manchester-lancashire-and-west-yorkshire"", Positive progress means 2 households can mix again in areas including Bolton, Stockport, Trafford, Hyndburn and Burnley. Some improvements in Leicester, with current restrictions remaining in place for a further 2 weeks as cases remain high. Following discussions with local leaders, the Health and Social Care Secretary, NHS Test and Trace, the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC), and the. Chief Medical Officer for England have agreed this week’s changes to local restrictions in some parts of England. From Wednesday 2 September restrictions on 2 households mixing introduced last month will be lifted in: Bolton, Stockport, Trafford, Burnley, Hyndburn, parts of Bradford excluding Bradford city and Keighley town, parts of Calderdale excluding Halifax, parts of Kirklees excluding Dewsbury and Batley. It means next week over 1 million people will be able to mix with family and friends outside their household, in line with national social distancing rules, for the first time since restrictions were announced on 30 July. Businesses and organisations that opened elsewhere in England on 15 August, including bowling alleys and indoor play areas, will also be permitted to reopen in the areas listed above, bringing these areas in line with the rest of the country. The easements have been agreed thanks to the outstanding local efforts to halt spikes in the virus, through local interventions, increased targeted testing and avoiding mixing with other households indoors. Data shows cases per 100,000 decreased during the week ending 20 August in Burnley, where cases have more than halved from 52 to 24.6, and cases in Bolton and Stockport fell from 25.6 to 18.9, and 23 to 15.1 respectively, and Trafford fell from 27.1 to 17.8. To maintain this good progress, it is important local residents continue to wear face coverings where necessary, practise good hygiene and adhere to national social distancing rules. This week local areas have been encouraged to take a new, collaborative approach to advise on the geographical boundaries of local restrictions, with councils, public health leaders and MPs making proposals to the Gold Local Action committee based on the latest data available. It means restrictions in some areas will only apply to certain wards, rather than the entire local authority area. This is a key part of the government’s enhanced Contain Strategy, which was announced last week, and will deliver more targeted action to drive down rates of COVID-19 at a hyper-local level. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: We brought in measures to protect people in these parts of Northern England, and I want to thank residents who have worked so hard to get on top of this virus. We’re seeing the positive results of our local approach, and are able to bring in increasingly targeted measures. It is vital we can maintain this good progress. I have every faith people across the county, especially in areas where we are seeing higher numbers of cases, will continue to play their part by following local rules, and self-isolating and requesting a free test as soon as they get any symptoms. The weekly Local Action Gold Committee, chaired by the Health and Social Care Secretary, agreed local restrictions will continue in the following areas. Greater Manchester: a ban on 2 households mixing indoors will continue in City of Manchester, Salford, Rochdale, Bury and Tameside in Oldham, in addition to a household mixing ban indoors, residents will continue to be advised to avoid mixing with anyone from anther household anywhere. Cases per 100,000 in Oldham reached 67.1 during the week ending 20 August, the second highest in England Lancashire: in Pendle and Blackburn residents will continue to be advised to avoid mixing with anyone from another household anywhere. Some businesses and organisations remain closed in Blackburn and Darwen. Pendle had the highest number of cases per 100,000 anywhere in England during the week ending 20 August, reaching 67.8 the ban on 2 households mixing indoors will continue in Preston. Leicester: on top of the indoor gatherings restrictions, some leisure sector businesses will continue to remain closed the next review of these measures will take place by 11 September. West Yorkshire: in urban areas of Bradford, the ban on indoor household gatherings remains in place and some businesses and organisations remain closed in Kirklees, the ban on indoor household gatherings will continue in Dewsbury and Batley the ban will also continue in parts of Calderdale. Shielding advice for clinical extremely vulnerable individuals remains in place across all of Blackburn with Darwen, and Leicester. The announcement on this week’s changes to local restrictions comes as the Health and Social Care Secretary has signed new national regulations formalising penalties for people who repeatably do not wear face coverings on public transport, shops and other areas where it is mandatory. Fines for not wearing face coverings start at £100, which can be reduced if paid within 14 days. Repeat offenders on public transport or in indoor settings will now have their fines doubled at each offence. After the first offence, there will be no discount. This means a second fine will amount to £200 and a third fine will be £400, up to a maximum value of £3,200. Background information. The full changes will be published on GOV.UK at Local restrictions: areas with an outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19). PHE’s weekly surveillance report includes changes to the watchlist of local authority areas with higher-than-average incidences of COVID-19. The changes are: Sandwell and Swindon move up the list and become ‘areas of enhanced support’. Luton becomes an ‘area of concern’ following a drop in cases. Trafford, Bolton, Stockport, Burnley, Hyndburn, Burnley, parts of Bradford, parts of Kirklees and parts of Calderdale are moved down the list, becoming areas of ‘enhanced support’. Stoke on-Trent is being added to the list for the first time as an ‘area of concern’. This week’s PHE surveillance report also included data on rates of COVID-19 by ethnicity and age in each major region in England. This will allow the public and local leaders to more easily see how the pandemic is affecting different ethnic groups across the country, and to inform action to protect our most vulnerable communities. The 3 definitions for JBC and PHE’s watchlist are ‘areas of concern’, ‘areas of enhanced support’ and ‘areas of intervention’: for ‘areas of concern’, upper tier local authorities will work with partners, supported by regional PHE and NHS Test and Trace resource, to take additional actions to manage outbreaks and reduce community spread of the virus to more normal levels. Actions taken may include additional targeted testing at high-risk areas or groups, for example care homes, enhanced communications around the importance of social distancing, hand hygiene and other preventative measures, and more detailed epidemiological work to understand where clusters of the virus are occurring so that appropriate action can be taken areas deemed for ‘enhanced support’ will be provided with increased national support, capacity and oversight, including additional resources deployed to augment the local teams where this is necessary. Actions taken may include significant additional widespread testing deployed to the upper tier local authorities, national support for local recommendations put in place to manage outbreaks, and detailed engagement with high-risk groups and sectors to help increase the effectiveness of testing and tracing in these areas ‘areas of intervention’ are defined where there is divergence from the lockdown measures in place in the rest of England because of the significance of the spread of COVID-19. There are a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions available to local and national leaders, from extensive communications and expanded testing, to restrictions on businesses and gatherings. See the Contain Framework for more information. Area-specific changes. Areas in Bradford where restrictions are being lifted: Worth Valley, Craven, Ilkley, Baildon, Bingley, Bingley Rural, Shipley, Wharfedale, Windhill and Wrose, Areas in Calderdale where restrictions are being lifted: Brighouse, Calder, Elland, Greenland and Stainland, Hipperholme and Lightcliffe, Luddendenfoot, Rastrick,Ryburn, Todmorden. Areas in Kirklees where restrictions are being lifted: Golcar, Greenhead, Heckmondwike, Holme Valley South, Lindley, Liversedge and Gomersal, Mirfield, Newsome, Cleckheaton, Dalton, Denby Dale, Almondbury, Colne Valley, Crosland Moor and Netherton, Holme Valley North, Kirkburton, Ashbrow, Birstall and Birkenshaw"
"Government has changed the law so most renters have a 6 month notice period,""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-has-changed-the-law-so-most-renters-have-a-6-month-notice-period"",""Landlords must provide at least 6 months‚Äô notice period prior to seeking possession through the courts in most cases."","""",""tag:www.gov.uk,2005:/government/news/government-has-changed-the-law-so-most-renters-have-a-6-month-notice-period"", The government is continuing to help renters with an unprecedented package of support measures. Legislation has now been introduced, so landlords must now give tenants 6 months’ notice before they can evict until March 2021, except in the most serious of cases, such as incidents of anti-social behaviour and domestic abuse perpetrators. The stay on possession proceedings has been extended until 20 September, meaning that in total no tenant can have been legally evicted for 6 months at the height of the pandemic. The package of support for renters includes the extension of notice periods and the extension to the stay on possession proceedings. For the most egregious cases, notice periods have returned to their pre-coronavirus levels, and landlords will be able to progress serious rent arrears cases more quickly. These changes mean that from 29 August, landlords must provide at least 6 months’ notice period prior to seeking possession through the courts in most cases, including_ section 21 evictions and rent arrears under 6 months. Notices served on and before 28 August are not affected by these changes, and must be at least 3 months. The government is also helping landlords affected by the worst cases to seek possession; these are: anti-social behaviour (now 4 weeks’ notice), domestic abuse (now 2 to 4 weeks’ notice), false statement (now 2 to 4 weeks’ notice), over 6 months’ accumulated rent arrears (now 4 weeks’ notice), breach of immigration rules ‘Right to Rent’ (now 3 months’ notice). In addition, new court rules have been agreed, which will come into force on 20 September meaning landlords will need to set out in their claim any relevant information about a tenant’s circumstances, including information on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Where this information is not provided, judges will have the ability to adjourn proceedings. Secretary of State for Housing, Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said: We have developed a package of support for renters to ensure they continue to be protected over winter. I have changed the law so that renters are protected by a 6 month notice period until March 2021. No tenant will have been legally evicted for 6 months at the height of the pandemic as the stay on possession proceedings has been extended until 20 September. For the most egregious cases, for example those involving anti-social behaviour or domestic abuse perpetrators, notice periods have returned to their normal level, and landlords will be able to progress serious rent arrears cases more quickly.These changes will support landlords to progress the priority cases while_keeping the public safe over winter._ We will keep these measures under review_and decisions_will continue_to be guided by the latest public health advice. The new legislation applies to both the private and social rented sectors in England, and to all new notices in relation to assured, assured shorthold, secure, flexible, introductory and demoted tenancies and those under the Rent Act 1977, but not to any notices issued before the legislation comes into force. Courts will carefully prioritise the most egregious cases, including anti-social behaviour, fraud, and domestic abuse, ensuring landlords are able to progress the most serious cases, such as those involving anti-social behaviour and other crimes. Further information: If a landlord made a claim to the court before 3 August, they must notify the Court and their tenant that they still intend to seek repossession before the case will proceed, including in section 21 cases. More detailed guidance on using the courts and the new arrangements will be made available in advance of possession proceedings starting again. We are conscious of the pressure on landlords during this difficult time and do not want to exacerbate this._ Of course, it is important that tenants who are able to_do so must continue to pay their rent. The government has put in place an unprecedented support package to support tenants to pay their living costs,_such as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, £9.3 billion of additional_support through the welfare system,_and_increasing the Local Housing Allowance rate to the 30th_percentile. We are committed to bringing forward the Renters Reform Bill to abolish section 21 and deliver a fairer and more effective rented sector in due course. However, such legislation must balance greater security of tenure with an assurance that landlords are able to recover their properties where they have valid reasons to do so. We have been working closely with the judiciary through a Master of the Rolls led Working Group to finalise the arrangements on the prioritisation of cases, for when the stay on possession proceedings lifts from 20 September. 29 August, landlords must provide at least 6 months’ notice period prior to seeking possession through the courts in most cases, including_ section 21 evictions and rent arrears under 6 months. We have also extended the validity of a section 21 notice from 6 to 10 months to accommodate this change."
"UK Government to fund COVID-19 research in Scotland,""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-to-fund-covid-19-research-in-scotland"",""The UK Government is investing ¬£8.4 million in COVID-19 immunology research projects, including at the universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee."","""",""tag:www.gov.uk,2005:/government/news/uk-government-to-fund-covid-19-research-in-scotland"", ""The UK Government is investing £8.4 million in COVID-19 immunology research projects across the UK, including the Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee. It is the biggest ever contribution to COVID-19 immunology research in the UK. Three new UK-wide studies will receive funding from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to understand immune responses to COVID-19. Together, it is hoped these studies will improve the treatment of patients and inform the development of vaccines and therapies. The Scottish universities are taking part in the largest study, the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium, which will receive £6.5 million and bring together leading immunologists from 17 UK universities. The University of Edinburgh is also involved in another study. Dr Christopher Lucas, University of Edinburgh, will lead a study titled ‘Inflammation in COVID-19: Exploration of Critical Aspects of Pathogenesis’, which will receive £394,000. It will focus on the key features of fatal COVID-19 and the impact the virus has upon the lungs and other vital organs. Using authorised hospital post-mortem examinations of patients who have died from COVID-19, this study will provide a unique opportunity for expert clinicians and scientists to study the whole body in a level of detail that is not possible during life. Dr Christopher Lucas said: We have learned so much from COVID-19 patients during the past six months. However, there is only so much that we can learn from clinical examinations and blood tests. By having a deeper look at those who have died from COVID-19 through post-mortem examination, we will increase our understanding of what is happening to the body in the most severe cases of this disease. Critically, this will allow us to rapidly answer key clinical questions and help inform the care of patients and the development of new treatments. The UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium will investigate key questions including: how long does immunity from COVID-19 last? why are some people’s immune systems better able to fight off the virus why do some people’s immune responses cause damage, especially to the lungs? how does the virus ‘hide from’ the immune system and how can this be tackled? does immunity to previous infection with seasonal coronaviruses (which cause the common cold) alter a person’s outcome with SARS-CoV-2? Better understanding of these immune responses, particularly the T cell response, could provide targets for new therapies to treat COVID-19 and inform the efforts to develop a vaccine. The project will use samples and data from major UK COVID-19 projects already underway, funded by UKRI and NIHR, including ISARIC-4C (characterizing and following more than 75,000 hospitalized patients with COVID-19) and the genomic studies COG-UK (sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes) and GenOMICC (sequencing the genomes of people with COVID-19). UK Government Minister for Scotland, Iain Stewart said: Scotland has a world-leading life science and research sector. This UK Government investment underpins the significance of our universities and academics nationally and internationally. We have much to learn about understanding immune responses to COVID-19. These studies, we hope, will improve the treatment of patients and inform scientists as they develop future treatment. It is a commendable contribution in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Professor Massimo Palmarini, Director of the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR) said: My colleagues and I at the CVR are extremely proud to be involved in the UK-CIC consortium, and are grateful to UKRI and NIHR for the generous funding support. It’s now more important than ever that the immunology community work together, as we aim to address important, unanswered questions about SARS-C0V-2 as we move through this pandemic."""
"Coronavirus (COVID-19): Cancellation and refund updates,""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/coronavirus-covid-19-cancellation-and-refund-updates"",The CMA has today published further detail on its views on the law in relation to cancellations and refunds during the pandemic."","""",""tag:www.gov.uk,2005:/government/news/coronavirus-covid-19-cancellation-and-refund-updates"", ""The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) remains of the view that a consumer will generally be entitled to a refund when they have paid money in advance for services or goods that cannot be provided because of the coronavirus pandemic. Given the evolving situation, the CMA has provided more detail on issues such as the difference between lockdown laws and government guidance, and their impact on cancellations and refunds. Lockdown laws. These are pieces of legislation such as the various Health Protection Regulations across the UK. If contracts cannot go ahead because of lockdown laws then, for most consumer contracts, the CMA would expect a consumer to be offered a full refund. If contracts are partially affected by lockdown laws then, depending on the circumstances and the scale of the impact, consumers may be entitled to a refund or a price reduction. Government guidance. The government has issued guidance in place of or in addition to lockdown laws. As these are guidance and not law, whether a consumer is entitled to a refund will vary according to the specific circumstances. For example, if a package holiday is cancelled in light of Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice against travel to the relevant country, there are specific protections which mean that consumers should be entitled to a full refund. In other situations, it will not always be the case that a full refund is due because government guidance does not create legal restrictions and will not necessarily mean that a contract cannot be performed. But even where that is the case, it is important for businesses and consumers to follow government guidance and it is the CMA’s view that businesses should treat their customers fairly and responsibly, including trying to find a mutually acceptable solution. The CMA has also written to certain package travel companies involved in group trips to explain its view on when customers should be offered a refund. This follows complaints about some package travel organisers advising customers that they are not entitled to a refund as their contract was between the company and a group, such as a school, rather than made directly with the customer. It is the CMA’s view that the Package Travel Regulations apply to these group travel packages, and that individual customers should be entitled to a refund if they have paid money in advance for a group trip that is cancelled because of the pandemic. The CMA’s statement on consumer protection law, setting out its views, is designed to help consumers understand their rights and to help businesses treat their customers fairly. Ultimately only a court can decide how the law applies in each circumstance. Head of the CMA’s Covid-19 Taskforce Will Hayter said: Our view is that consumers will generally be entitled to a refund when they have paid in advance for services or goods that cannot be provided because of legal restrictions as a result of the pandemic. If complying with government guidance adversely impacts consumers, our message to businesses is that they should treat their customers fairly and responsibly - including trying to find a mutually acceptable solution. In the case of package holidays, including some group trips, if these are cancelled because of the pandemic, for example because of changing Foreign Office travel advice, our clear view is that individual customers who have paid in advance should be entitled to a full refund. Today’s updates come as part of wider CMA work on cancellations and refunds, which has included commitments from major holiday lets firms Sykes Cottages and Vacation Rentals to offer people refunds for cancelled bookings.

"New measures to support development of safe COVID-19 vaccines for UK,""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-measures-to-support-development-of-safe-covid-19-vaccines-for-uk"",""A raft of measures to allow the safe future mass rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine have been outlined by the government."","""",""tag:www.gov.uk,2005:/government/news/new-measures-to-support-development-of-safe-covid-19-vaccines-for-uk"", Measures will allow UK-wide rollout of vaccine to save lives and bring pandemic to an end. Proposals to bolster safeguards and improve access to protect the public ahead of the winter. COVID-19 vaccines will only be given to UK patients if proven to be safe and effective. A raft of measures to allow the safe future mass rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine have been outlined by the government today (Friday 28 August). The new rules and safeguards will strengthen the UK’s ability to successfully deploy a UK-wide vaccination programme, which will be crucial in saving lives and bringing the current pandemic to an end. The measures include: reinforced safeguards to support the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to grant temporary authorisation for the use of a new COVID-19 vaccine _ provided it meets the highest safety and quality standards, expanding the trained workforce who can administer COVID-19 and flu vaccines to improve access and protect the public, clarifying the scope of the protection from civil liability for the additional workforce that could be allowed to administer vaccinations. If a vaccine is discovered before 2021, the proposals will bolster existing powers that allow the MHRA to consider approving its use, before a full product licence is granted, provided it is proven to be safe and effective during robust and extensive clinical trials. The measures are necessary because during the transition period, a new potential COVID-19 vaccine must be granted a licence by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The regulations will permit the MHRA to consider giving temporary authorisation allowing patients to benefit while it undergoes the full licensing process, with reinforced conditions attached to ensure safety, quality and efficacy. This is a precautionary measure and will be used as a last resort if there is a strong public health justification for widespread use of a vaccine before it has been granted a product licence. From 2021, MHRA will have a national licensing system in place and will be responsible for granting licences for potential COVID-19 vaccines and treatments once they meet high standards of safety and effectiveness. Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, said: We are making progress in developing COVID-19 vaccines which we hope will be important in saving lives, protecting healthcare workers and returning to normal in future. If we develop effective vaccines, it’s important we make them available to patients as quickly as possible but only once strict safety standards have been met. The proposals consulted on today suggest ways to improve access and ensure as many people are protected from COVID-19 and flu as possible without sacrificing the absolute need to ensure that any vaccine used is both safe and effective. The MHRA has the power to grant an unlicensed medicine or a vaccine temporary authorisation where a product is proven to be safe and effective and is in the best interest of the patient on the basis of available evidence. A consultation is being launched today, which will look to amend the Human Medicine Regulations 2012 and will last 3 weeks, seeking the opinions and advice on the proposals from health experts and key stakeholder groups. The measures could come into force by October, ahead of the winter season. Dr Christian Schneider, Director of National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) _ part of the MHRA _ said: Protecting health and saving lives is at the heart of all our work. Throughout the pandemic, the MHRA has prioritised work to ensure rapid approval of robust clinical trials to test a range of medicines and vaccines, whilst maintaining the highest quality and safety standards. Whilst the existing licensing system, or a new UK one from next year, is the preferred and expected route to supply any vaccine, these new measures will strengthen the regulatory regime and our ability to protect public health. The proposals will also allow more fully trained healthcare professionals to administer vaccines under NHS and local authority occupational health schemes, as well as enable an expanded workforce that can administer vaccinations to the public. This will make it easier and quicker for patients to access the vaccines they need, protecting them against potentially serious and fatal diseases. The expanded workforce will undergo a robust training programme, and could include a wider range of existing NHS staff, as well as groups such as student doctors and nurses. The consultation will also look at clarifying the scope of the protection from civil liability, which the regulations already give to healthcare workers and manufacturers, to ensure it applies to the companies which order the medicines and the additional workforce that could be allowed to administer vaccinations. This will establish a fairer and more equal footing and encourage companies to place cutting-edge medicines on the markets as soon as possible, ensuring UK patients can be the first to benefit.

Data from the Joint Biosecurity Centre and Public Health England has indicated a significant change in both the level and pace of confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in these countries, leading to ministers removing them from the current list of travel corridors. There has been a consistent increase in the weekly incidence (case) rate of COVID-19 in Switzerland over the past 4 weeks, with a 19% increase in weekly incidence (cases) per 100,000 between the 20 and 27 August 2020, from 18.5 on the 20 August to 22.0 on the 27 August. Data shows that there has been a consistent increase in newly reported cases in the Czech Republic over the past 3 weeks, with a 25% increase from 1,723 between the 14 and 20 August 2020 to 2,153 between the 21 and 27 August. Data from Jamaica shows that the weekly incidence (cases) per 100,000 has increased from 4.3 on 20 August 2020 to 20.8 on 27 August. This equates to a 382% increase. Cuba has been added to the government’s travel corridor list following a decrease in confirmed cases of coronavirus. From 4am Saturday 29 August, passengers arriving to England from Cuba will no longer need to self-isolate so long as they haven’t been in or transited through any other non-exempt countries in the 14 days preceding their arrival. Infections from COVID-19 are on the rise across Europe. The government has made consistently clear it will take decisive action if necessary to contain the virus, which includes removing countries from the travel corridors list rapidly, if the public health risk of people returning from a particular country without self-isolating becomes too high. This means holidaymakers may find they need to self isolate on return to the UK and are advised to consider the implications of self-isolation on them and their families before making travel plans. People currently in Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Jamaica are encouraged to follow the local rules and check the FCO travel advice pages for further information. The government is urging employers to be understanding of those returning from these destinations who now will need to self-isolate. COVID-19 has profoundly changed the nature of international travel. Travellers should always check the latest advice from the FCO, given the potential for changing coronavirus infection rates to affect both the advice about travelling to other countries and rules about self-isolation on return. All travellers, including those from destinations on the travel corridors list, will still be required to show a completed passenger locator form on arrival into the UK unless they fall into a small group of exemptions."

Demand for testing across the country continues to grow. Since mid-June the number of people getting newly tested has increased by 57% with over 440,000 people newly tested in the latest week of statistics (13 August to 19 August). In response, the largest network of diagnostic testing facilities in British history, built from scratch, continues to grow. This includes expanding testing sites and investing in new technologies to have a 500,000 per day capacity by the end of October. Ongoing work means that more tests are being made available each day, with testing capacity allocated based on areas of greatest need and prevalence of the virus. Interim Executive Chair of the National Institute for Health Protection Baroness Dido Harding, said: This week marks a milestone for NHS Test and Trace, which has now been in operation for more than 3 months. The statistics published today show that every week we consistently reach the majority of people testing positive and their contacts, and have now reached almost 300,000 people who may have unknowingly passed the virus on. This country now has the capacity to test for coronavirus and trace contacts on an unprecedented scale to stop the spread of the virus. We will continue to build the service further to reach more and more people and to scale up our testing capacity by expanding our network of testing sites and investing in new technologies. I urge everyone to use NHS Test and Trace to help everyone get back to a more normal way of life. If you have symptoms, book a test immediately, and if you are contacted by the service, follow the advice you receive. Statistics from the 12th week of operation of NHS Test and Trace (13 to 19 August) show that since the service launched: 297,138 people have been reached by the service. This includes both those testing positive and their contacts 80.6% of all contacts identified were reached, which increases to 88.3% for those we had contact information for 4,389,503 people have been newly tested under pillars 1 and 2"
"New payment for people self-isolating in highest risk areas,""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-payment-for-people-self-isolating-in-highest-risk-areas"",""People on low incomes who need to self-isolate and are unable to work from home in areas with high incidence of COVID-19 will benefit from a new payment scheme."","""",""tag:www.gov.uk,2005:/government/news/new-payment-for-people-self-isolating-in-highest-risk-areas"", People on low incomes who need to self-isolate and are unable to work from home in areas with high incidence of COVID-19 will benefit from a new payment scheme starting on Tuesday 1 September, the Health Secretary has announced today. Starting with a trial in Blackburn with Darwen, Pendle and Oldham to ensure the process works, eligible individuals who test positive with the virus will receive £130 for their 10-day period of self-isolation. Other members of their household, who have to self-isolate for 14 days, will be entitled to a payment of £182. Non-household contacts advised to self-isolate through NHS Test and Trace will also be entitled to a payment of up to £182, tailored to the individual length of their isolation period. It is designed to support people who are unable to work from home while self-isolating, either after testing positive, or after being identified by NHS Test and Trace as living in the same household as – or coming into contact with – someone who has tested positive. It will be available to people currently receiving either Universal Credit or Working Tax Credit. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: The British public have already sacrificed a great deal to help slow the spread of the virus. Self-isolating if you have tested positive for COVID-19, or have come into contact with someone who has, remains vital to keeping on top of local outbreaks. This new payment scheme will help people on low incomes and who are unable to work from home to continue playing their part in the national fight against this virus. Payments will be provided within 48 hours of the eligible individual providing the necessary evidence. Individuals will be asked to provide a notification from NHS Test and Trace and a bank statement. The local authority can also check the NHS Test and Trace system to confirm the individual has been asked to self-isolate, if the individual is unable to provide this information. The local authority will put in place checks to prevent fraud and ensure compliance through welfare check-ins, phone calls and employment checks. There will be a rapid review of the scheme in Blackburn with Darwen, Pendle and Oldham to assess the performance consider how effectively vulnerable people have been reached, and consider how far it has helped reduce transmission of the virus in these areas. If the approach is successful, the scheme will be quickly applied in other areas of high COVID-19 incidence. Background information This will not reduce any other benefits that they receive. This payment equates to: £130 if an individual has tested positive for coronavirus and has to self-isolate for 10 days (from the point they first developed symptoms) £182 if a member of an individual’s household has tested positive for coronavirus and they are asked to self-isolate for 14 days (from the point the member of their household first developed symptoms) £13 per day (up to a maximum of £182) if an individual is identified as a non-household contact of another person who has tested positive for coronavirus and is asked to self-isolate up until 14 days after they were most recently in contact with the person who tested positive. To be eligible for the funding, individuals must: have tested positive for COVID-19 or received a notification from NHS Test and Trace asking them to self-isolate, have agreed to comply with the notification from NHS Test and Trace and provided contact details to the local authority be employed or self-employed: employed people will be asked to show proof of employment, self-employed will be required to show evidence of trading income and that their business delivers services which the local authority reasonably judges they are unable to carry out without social contact, be unable to work from home (checks will be undertaken on all applicants) and will lose income a result, be currently receiving Universal Credit or Working Tax Credit"
"Government funding for St Basils' youth homelessness programme,""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-funding-for-st-basils-youth-homelessness-programme"",""Youth homelessness charity St Basils to benefit from ¬£90,000 to support young people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness."","""",""tag:www.gov.uk,2005:/government/news/government-funding-for-st-basils-youth-homelessness-programme"", ""Youth homelessness charity St Basils will benefit from £90,000 to enable it to continue its vital work supporting young people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, Luke Hall has announced today (26 August 2020). The funding will enable the charity to continue its Youth Voice Programme where selected young homeless people from across the country feed their experience into government and other public sector organisations, ensuring their voices are heard. St Basils will also undertake a detailed review into the experiences, needs and issues facing young people in the West Midlands who were housed as part of the government’s ‘Everyone In’ scheme during the COVID-19 response. The insights, recommendations and learnings from St Basils’ study will be shared, to build on the government’s ongoing evidence base on what works to prevent future homelessness amongst young people. The government is funding St Basils’ work to support young homeless people as part of its landmark commitment – backed by over half a billion pounds to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping over 2020/21 – to break the cycle of homelessness and end rough sleeping for good. Measures also include the Next Steps Accommodation Programme, which funds local authorities and their partners to prevent people from returning to the streets, and the fast-tracking 6,000 additional homes for former rough sleepers across the country. Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, Luke Hall MP said: We have taken unprecedented action to support the most vulnerable people in our society during the pandemic. I’m delighted we’re able to continue to support St Basils this year with £90,000 to continue their well-established and successful Youth Voice Programme. This will enable them to continue their hugely valuable work to ensure the voices of young homeless people are heard by the government and wider public sector. Nationally, we have put in place bespoke support for councils through our Homelessness Advice and Support Team, which includes dedicated youth homelessness advisers. The Youth Advisers are working closely with councils on the particular challenges that young people and care leavers are facing during COVID-19. Nearly 15,000 vulnerable people have been housed in emergency accommodation since the beginning of the pandemic and we are funding longer-term accommodation – 3,300 homes this year alone – and tailored support so as few people as possible return to life on the streets. Jean Templeton, CEO of St Basils, welcomed the funding, and said: We are really pleased to secure this funding and continue to enable young people from across the country to have their experiences and voices heard. It is particularly important at this time that young people can influence policy and investment decisions. Ensuring young people have truly affordable accommodation and support which underpins their ability to live, work, earn and learn is critical if we are to prevent an increase in youth homelessness. Their lived experience makes an invaluable contribution to the development of policy priorities and resource allocation. The more young people can be engaged in making decisions about their own lives the more likely they are to successfully move into independence. This funding will provide valuable insight into the experiences of young people during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the challenges they face. Over the course of the pandemic, the government has prioritised protecting the most vulnerable people by housing 15,000 people, including rough sleepers, in emergency accommodation. This includes a number of young people aged 18-25 years old. St Basils’ review will bring together anonymous data on the profile of young people in the West Midlands housed under the scheme as well as information on accommodation options and support levels and types offered under it and plans for move-on accommodation. The government has planned effective responses to support young people in taking advantage of opportunities for move on, recovery and building a pathway to a more sustainable and independent future. The review will also allow government to further tailor plans to prevent future homelessness amongst young people at risk of being made homeless as a result of immediate Covid-related pressures or longer-term economic pressures and job losses resulting from the pandemic. Further information: The government has made clear that no one should be without a roof over their head, which is why we have committed to end rough sleeping within this Parliament._The work of the Rough Sleeping Taskforce further demonstrates our commitment to supporting the most vulnerable in society. We have provided £4.3 billion to help councils to manage the impacts of COVID-19, which includes their work to support homeless people, including £3.7 billion which is not ringfenced, and £600 million to support social care. Also, we have accelerated_plans – backed by £433 million over the next 4 years – which will deliver 6,000 additional homes for former rough sleepers across the country. On 18 July, we launched the Next Steps Accommodation Programme (NSAP). This makes available the financial resources needed to support local authorities and their partners to prevent these people from returning to the streets. The NSAP_is_made up of 2_sources_of funding: £161 million_to_deliver 3,300 units of_longer term move-on accommodation_within the next 12 months (part of the £433 million total); and £105 million_of additional funding to pay for immediate_support_to ensure that people do not return to the streets. We are supporting these efforts as part of our landmark commitment – backed by over half a billion pounds this year – to break the cycle of homelessness and end rough sleeping for good. St Basils has been funded by MHCLG since 2012 to develop a network of young people with lived experience of homelessness across England. There will be currently 32 trained members of Youth Voice this year, with member in all nine regions of England. This government implemented the Homelessness Reduction Act, the most ambitious reform to homelessness legislation in decades, which placed new duties on local housing authorities to take reasonable steps to try to prevent and relieve a person’s homelessness. These new duties apply irrespective of whether a person has ‘priority need’ or may be regarded as being ‘intentionally homeless’. This means that many more young people who may not previously have been eligible for support, are now being helped to prevent homelessness before it even occurs. The Act also places a duty on public bodies, including Children’s Services, Youth Offending Institutions and Youth Offending Teams ensuring better partnership working between public bodies and local authorities to prevent youth homelessness. We have put in place bespoke support for local authorities through our Homelessness Advice and Support Team, which includes dedicated youth homelessness advisers who have a commitment to work with local authorities to proactively promote positive joint working across housing authorities and children’s services, offering training, advice and support to all local authorities."
"Over 64 million meals claimed for as Eat Out to Help Out enters fourth week,""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/over-64-million-meals-claimed-for-as-eat-out-to-help-out-enters-fourth-week"",""More than 64 million meals have been enjoyed by diners across the country since the launch of the government‚ Eat Out to Help Out discount scheme."","""",""tag:www.gov.uk,2005:/government/news/over-64-million-meals-claimed-for-as-eat-out-to-help-out-enters-fourth-week"", This continues the upward trend in the scheme’s popularity, with 10.5 million meals claimed for in the first week, growing to a total of 35 million meals in the second. Data from OpenTable shows that during Eat Out to Help Out’s third week the number of customers at UK restaurants was 61% higher than the same days last year on average for Monday to Wednesday. The average level across Monday to Wednesday in the first and second week were 12% and 41% respectively. The data also shows that the number of customers at UK restaurants was up 17% compared to the same week in 2019. A total of 87,000 claims have been made by many of the signed-up businesses and there have been over 34 million searches on Eat Out to Help Out’s restaurant finder from 13 million unique users. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said: Today’s figures continue to show that Brits are backing hospitality – with more than 64 million meals discounted so far, that’s equivalent to nearly every person in the country dining out to protect jobs. This scheme has reminded us how much we love to dine out, and in doing so, how this is helping to protect the jobs of nearly 2 million people who work in hospitality. I am urging everyone, where they can, to continue to safely enjoy a meal while the scheme remains open. There are now 84,000 sign-ups from restaurants for the scheme, which closes on 31 August. The Eat Out to Help Out scheme aims to help protect the jobs of the hospitality industry’s 1.8 million employees by encouraging people to safely return to their local restaurants, cafes and pubs where social-distancing rules allow. Around 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April, with 1.4 million workers furloughed, the highest of any sector. David Page, Chairman of Fulham Shore (Franco Manca/The Real Greek) said: The Government’s furlough scheme underpinned our effort to save as many jobs as possible at Franco Manca and The Real Greek. This innovative policy was then followed by the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. Eat Out to Help Out immediately increased our restaurant customer numbers by over 50%, thus enabling us to get all our staff back to work. In fact, we are now creating new jobs by hiring and training more people as fast as we can! Andy Laurillard, CEO, Giggling Squid said: Rishi’s dishes have been a massive hit with customers and our staff. The tremendous success of the August scheme, combined with the temporary VAT reduction and fantastic support from our landlord community have made the difference between failure and survival of our business. As a result of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme we have managed to avoid making any redundancies and we no longer have any of our 950 staff on furlough. The scheme applies to all food and non-alcoholic drinks with participating establishments deducting 50% from the bill, up to a maximum discount per person of £10. It could save a family of four up to £40 per meal. Businesses have become Covid-secure through, for example, protective screens, contactless payments, social distancing, one way walking systems, online bookings and reduced capacity. The scheme is one part of the Chancellor’s Plan for Jobs, announced last month. Other measures announced to protect, support and create jobs include cutting VAT for tourism and hospitality by 15%, a £2 billion Kickstart Scheme and an £8.8 billion investment in new infrastructure, decarbonisation and maintenance projects. This support for the hospitality sector comes on top of the government’s unprecedented assistance for all businesses including through grants, tax deferrals, scrapping business rates, the furlough and self-employed support schemes and government-backed loans.

There is no minimum spend and the discount can be used at the same time as other offers and discounts. The maximum discount per person is £10. All diners in a group of any size will qualify for the automatic discount. 8% of the UK’s workforce – over 2.4 million people – rely on hospitality, accommodation and attractions for employment. Of this, food and beverage services (pubs, restaurants, cafes etc) account for 1.8 million jobs. 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million hospitality workers have been furloughed – the highest proportions of any sector.
